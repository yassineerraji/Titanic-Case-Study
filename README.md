# Titanic-Case-Study

This project explores the Titanic dataset and applies various data analysis and visualization techniques to understand the factors influencing passenger survival. The case study includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and a detailed analysis of survival rates based on different features like gender, age, and class.

Key Features:

	•	Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing survival rates across various passenger attributes such as gender, class, and age.
	•	Statistical Insights: Gained insights from patterns and distributions within the dataset.
	•	Machine Learning Models: Applied models to predict survival chances of passengers.
